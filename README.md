# Lento: Goal-Based Productivity

Lento is a goal-based productivity app for Windows and macOS, incorporating
distraction blockers and to-do lists. There are a lot of similar products out
there, but we built Lento because we couldn't find an alternative with all of
the features we wanted.

## Features

- Set different goals for different things, each with their own blocklists and
notification presets.
- Ability to block both apps and websites.
- Can easily set preset time lengths for different goals.
- Automatically disables your ability to turn a session off before the block
time runs out.
- "Soft blocks" where you are given a prompt when opening an app/site instead
of an outright block.
- Persistent block that survives across uninstalls, logouts, and reboots.
- Browser agnostic (works with your favourite browser, whether it's Chrome,
Firefox, Edge, Safari, Vivaldi, or another!).
- Advanced notification functionality: remind yourself of your goals at set
intervals/on idle/when switching apps.
- Clean, easy to use UI.
- Works across Windows and macOS (Linux support coming soon).
- Built with Python, free, and open source!

## Installing

Work is in progress on installers. For now, you'll need to clone the
repository and run `app.py` directly.
