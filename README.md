# Lento: A Modern Distraction Blocker

Lento is a modern distraction blocker for Windows and macOS, built with Python. There are a lot of similar products out there, but I built Lento because I couldn't find an alternative with all of the features I wanted.

## Features
- Multiple, easily swappable blocklists
- Ability to block both apps and websites
- Can easily set different preset time lengths for different blocklists
- Automatically disables your ability to turn the block off before the block time runs out
- "Soft blocks" where you are given a prompt when visiting an app/site instead of an outright block
- Persistent block that survives across uninstalls, logouts, and reboots
- Browser agnostic (works with your favourite browser, whether it's Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Vivaldi, or another!)
- Clean, easy to use UI
- Free and open source!

## Installing
You can download the latest release [here]() or from the [Releases page]() on the GitHub Repo.

If you want to build from source:

## Contributing
I'm currently not accepting any PRs or outside commits to this repo, but feel free to open issues with any feedback you might have!
