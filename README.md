# Lento: A Modern Distraction Blocker

Lento is a modern distraction blocker for Windows and macOS, built with Python. There are a lot of similar products out there, but I built Lento because I couldn't find an alternative with all of the features I wanted.

## Features
- Multiple, easily swappable sessions, each with their own blocklists
- Ability to block both apps and websites
- Can easily set different preset time lengths for different session
- Automatically disables your ability to turn the session off before the block time runs out
- "Soft blocks" where you are given a prompt when visiting an app/site instead of an outright block
- Persistent block that survives across uninstalls, logouts, and reboots
- Browser agnostic (works with your favourite browser, whether it's Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Vivaldi, or another!)
- Advanced notification functionality: remind yourself of your goals at set intervals/on idle/when switching apps
- Clean, easy to use UI
- Works across Windows and macOS (Linux support coming soon)
- Free and open source!

## Installing
